<h1>Raspberry Pi PICO running with CircuitPython</h1>
<hr>
<p>This is a place where I will store initial work on using the Raspberry Pi PICO</p>
<p>"Code.py" and "Dave.py" can be dropped right into your PICO folder once connected.</p>
<p>Initial work is with getting 10k commercial thermistors to work and read properly</p>
<p>My IDE of choice is Visual Studio Code, with github, MagicPython, and CircuitPython extensions 
added in order to gain Intellisense for the CP package.</p>
<p>Additionally, I've found that the 'cu' app under Linux does just fine as a serial monitor for the PICO.  I couldn't get the one with the extensions to operate correctly.</p>
